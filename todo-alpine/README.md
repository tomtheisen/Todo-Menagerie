# Alpine Todo list

It took about 80 minutes from zero alpine knowledge.  This is particularly helped by having no build(!)  Everything basically just made sense.  I got hung up a bit on `delete` keyword/function declaration confusion.

I found it all very refreshing.

I didn't see a way to use typescript in a meaningful way.  It seems to suffer from the biggest drawback (IMO) of knockout, which is the bindings/directives can't be type-checked.
