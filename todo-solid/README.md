## Solid To-do

It took me 62 minutes to build the todo list in solid.  I've skimmed the docs before, but haven't written any code.

The experience was less magical than I was imagining.  I might be missing something about arrays, but I am doing a lot of slicing and spreading.  `push` seems to be a no-go.

`Array.prototype.with` has been standardized, but it's too new to be even in the ESNext target for typescript.  That would have helped a bit.
