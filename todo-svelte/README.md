# Todo in Svelte

This one took me 93 minutes with no prior exposure.  It's definitely a "bigger concept" approach than vue.  Everything's a bigger concept than alpine.

It has a single file component concept like vue.  The reactivity is a little more galaxy-brain.  I had to do some nasty hacks to get updates at certain times.

Svelte seems to have a clear distinction between svelte things and standard things.  It's unapologetic about creating its own semantics, but is careful to distinguish them from the underlying platform.  This is not "just javascript".
