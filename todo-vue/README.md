# Vue todo list

I got it running in 60 minutes in Vue with no familiarity.  There were some notable similarities to Alpine.  And some notable differences.

It seems pretty clear that the Alpine directives were significantly influenced by the design of the Vue directives.  They both generate some invalid HTML.  I probably lost that battle a long time ago.

One nice difference was that typescript just worked.  Not just built, but I got intellisense from inside a "Single File Component", which is some kind of unholy amalgam.  But I kind of like it.

Also there was a giant vite/dev server/HMR/web socket/bundle monstrosity.  I didn't attempt to figure any of it out, but it stayed out of my way.
